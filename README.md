# tcltools

The purpose of this repository is recollect all the small tcl tools that I use to do just for testing or fun. Usually these kind of codes end up lost on my computer. From now on, I will try to upload them here. I hope it helps.

## Usage, installation, etc.

Each tool will have his own README.md file with his particularities.
